## FAQ

**What is MockLocation ?**

Both iOS and Android created MockedLocation as a developer feature years ago. This allowed developers to test location-aware features on their apps and was only enabled using explicit settings on developer-mode or the simulator. But a few users might use this feature for their advantage, maybe for unlocking location based stuff. **This is where this library helps you**
